```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

This app development book is for beginner to intermediate-level developers who want to become mobile developers. Basic knowledge of modern programming languages such as JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin, Java, Objective-C, or C# will help you to understand the concepts covered in the book more easily.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-15).
